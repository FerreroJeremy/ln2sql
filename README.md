# ln2sql

ln2sql is a NLP tool to query a database in natural language, as described in the French paper :

<i> Benoît Couderc and Jérémy Ferrero. fr2sql : Database Query in French. (fr2sql : Interrogation de bases de données en français [in French]). In Proceedings of 17th RECITAL (join with 22th TALN Conference). June 2015. Caen, France. ATALA. pp.1-12</i>

In view to learn Python, I recently decided to implement our PHP ln2sql tool in Python. In addition, that will allow me to share the tool with the English-speaking community by making it public available.
